## keygen (private-key-hex-wif-generator)

The provided Python code performs the following actions:

- It imports the `secrets` module to generate secure random values.

- The function `generate_private_key()` is defined to generate a random 256-bit private key (32 bytes) using the `secrets` module.

- The generated private key is then converted to its hexadecimal representation and printed as output.

- The code further imports the `base58` and `hashlib` modules.

- It defines the function `hex_to_wif(hex_private_key)` to convert a given hexadecimal private key to a Wallet Import Format (WIF) key.

- The function adds a prefix byte '80' to the hexadecimal private key, indicating a mainnet private key in the crypto context.

- The extended private key is double-hashed using the SHA-256 hash function.

- The first 4 bytes of the second hash are taken as a checksum.

- The checksum is appended to the end of the extended private key.

- The extended private key with the checksum is `base58` encoded to obtain the WIF key.

- The WIF key is returned by the function.

- The previously generated private key is converted to its corresponding WIF key using the `hex_to_wif` function.

- The resulting WIF key is printed as output.

In summary, the code generates a random private key, converts it to hexadecimal format, and then converts the hexadecimal private key into a Wallet Import Format (WIF) key, which is commonly used in crypto systems for securely managing private keys.
